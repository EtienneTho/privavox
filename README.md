# Sleep deprivation measured by voice analysis

This repository contains the Python & Matlab scripts to run the analyses of the paper: Thoret, E., Andrillon, T., Gauriau, C., Leger, D., Pressnitzer, D. (2022) Sleep deprivation measured by voice analysis, bioRxiv. 10.1101/2022.11.17.516913 10.1101/2022.11.17.516913

Python scripts perform the Machine Learning analyses but if data are put in the folder (see below) the analyses can be done with the Matlab scripts solely.

## Data

The data are available at the following link (10.17605/OSF.IO/QUJKD). dataSTMTF.zip must be unzip in the main folder.
The full output can be downloaded at the same link in the archive 'out.zip'
